I am currently taking the C# Mastercourse by Tim Corey. He is an excellent teacher and this code belongs to him. I simply followed along, tried my best to work through it, and created my own copy as he guided me through the process. This Console UI project puts all the foundational parts of C# I have been learning into one application.

The Basic Requirements for this project are: 
- To build a small, two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship. 
- There will be a 25-spot grid (A1-E5). 
- Each player will place five pegs on the board to represent their five ships. 
- Players will then take turns firing on their opponent's ships. 
- The first person to sink all five ships wins.
