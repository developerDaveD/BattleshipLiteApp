This Console UI project puts all the foundational parts of C# I have learned together into one application.

The Basic Requirements are: 
- To build a small, two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship. 
- There will be a 25-spot grid (A1-E5). 
- Each player will place five pegs on the board to represent their five ships. 
- Players will then take turns firing on their opponent's ships. 
- The first person to sink all five ships wins.
